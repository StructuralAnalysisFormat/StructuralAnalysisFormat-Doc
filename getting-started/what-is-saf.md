# What is SAF?

## Welcome to SAF

SAF is an initiative from the Nemetschek Group to improve the collaboration between structural engineers by developing an open exchange format for exchanging data between structural analysis software based on the Excel format. It is focusing on a practical, easy to use, format that can be used in daily practice by structural engineers. It is meant as an open format and we look forward to you joining this initiative.

The structural analysis software companies participating in this initiative today are presented in chapter ["Who supports SAF?](who-supports-saf.md)["](who-supports-saf.md).

The coordination is currently managed by SCIA. If you are interested in joining, please contact Herman Oogink, Director Product and Alliances at SCIA.
