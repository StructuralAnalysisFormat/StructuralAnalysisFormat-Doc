# StructuralPointAction

**Point force**

Instances of StructuralPointAction define a point load applied to the node ([StructuralPointConnection](../structural-analysis-elements/structuralpointconnection.md)) and also the location of the point load on a 1D member ([StructuralCurveMember](../structural-analysis-elements/structuralcurvemember.md)).

The point force can be defined in three main directions (global or local coordinate system). Every point force has to be assigned to a load case.

## Notes

>An example of use of Repeat (n) is given below. The forces are distributed uniformly meaning that the value Delta x is used for uniform distribution along the 1D member for multiple point forces.
