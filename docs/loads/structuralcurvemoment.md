# StructuralCurveMoment

**Line Moment on the beam**

The Line moment load models load distributed over a 1D member ([StructuralCurveMember](../structural-analysis-elements/structuralcurvemember.md)), 1D member Rib ([StructuralCurveMemberRib](../structural-analysis-elements/structuralcurvememberrib.md)) or on a slab edge ([StructuralSurfaceMember](../structural-analysis-elements/structuralsurfacemember.md)). It may be action along the whole 1D member or only on its part. It can be constant or trapezoidal, acting in three main directions X, Y, Z (global or local coordinate system).

>An example with Distribution type Trapez and with different values 1 and 2 can be seen in the following picture. Coordinate definition is relative, start point 0 and end point 0,3. StructuralCurveAction 1 has origin "From start" and StructuralCurveAction 2 has origin "From end". In this case the parameter extent doesn’t make any difference, only in case of beams consisting of more parts.

> For 'Local' coordinate system (LCS) the load is defined in the LCS of the member it is assigned to. For force action 'On beam' and 'On rib' it is the LCS of [StructuralCurveMember](../structural-analysis-elements/structuralcurvemember.md) and [StructuralCurveMemberRib](../structural-analysis-elements/structuralcurvememberrib.md), respectively. For edges of 2D members the local coordinate system of an edge is used and it is created accordingly:
> * X-axis is in the direction of the line/curve of the edge. The direction is specified by the order of nodes in the [StructuralSurfaceMember](../structural-analysis-elements/structuralsurfacemember.md)
> * Z-axis is parallel to the local Z-axis of the 2D member. For curved members local Z-axis is always perpendicular to the surface
> * Y-axis is tangential to the 2D member (it is in its plane) and the direction is set by the right-hand rule
