# StructuralSurfaceMemberOpening

## Opening in surface member

Instances of StructuralSurfaceMemberOpening describe openings in face members ([StructuralSurfaceMember](structuralsurfacemember.md#2d-member-plate-wall)). The geometry of the opening object is defined in the same way as geometry of 2D members - may be planar or curved with an arbitrary number of edges.

Parent ID will ensure that curved edge is imported as straight parts to nonsupporting application, and back to original supporting application as curved geometry. To ensure successful round trip of segmented objects and their related objects, Parent ID needs to be present in both directions. |
