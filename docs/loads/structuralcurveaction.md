# StructuralCurveAction

**Line force on the beam**

The Line force load models load distributed over a 1D member or on a slab edge. It may be action along the whole 1D member or only on its part. It can be constant or trapezoidal, acting in three main directions X, Y, Z (global or local coordinate system).

## Notes

>Difference between Location type Length and Projection can be seen in the picture. Location is used only if Coordinate system is Global.

>An example of use of parameter Extent is in the in the picture below. In case of Span the load acts only on the span which is defined by internal nodes

>An example with Distribution type Trapez and with different values 1 and 2 can be seen in the following picture. Coordinate definition is relative, start point 0 and end point 0,3. StructuralCurveAction 1 has origin "From start" and StructuralCurveAction 2 has origin "From end". In this case the parameter extent doesn’t make any difference, only in case of beams consisting of more parts.
