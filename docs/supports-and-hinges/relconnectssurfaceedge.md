# RelConnectsSurfaceEdge

**Hinges on 2D member edge**

A connection of two slabs (2D members) may be modelled as a fixed one or a hinge may be inserted to create a pinned connection. Three configurations of slab hinge are allowed: rigid, free, flexible. Under any configuration, all translations are fully transferred from one slab to the other. If there is no hinge, the connection is rigid.

```{warning}
This object is referring to the edge of StructuralSurfaceMember. Only for this object the indexing of edges starts with "0". All other objects are referencing with "1" based indexing.
