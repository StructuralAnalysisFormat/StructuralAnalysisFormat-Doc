# StructuralCurveMember

**1D Member (Beam, Column,â€¦)**

A general 1D member is defined by its two end-points (or we can say nodes). Therefore, the 1D member position must be specified by two points: first, the starting or begin point and then the end point. A set of properties can also be defined.

Each 1D member has got a unique local co-ordinate system, the origin of which is located in the starting point of a 1D member. The x-axis is always identical with the longitudinal beam axis and its direction is from the starting point towards the end point and is placed to centroid of the cross-section. By default, the y-axis is generally horizontal (unless the beam orientation prevents this) and the z-axis is generally vertical (again, unless the beam orientation in space prevents this configuration). In case of vertical members by default the local y-axis has the same direction as global y-axis.

The local co-ordinate system can be rotated around its x-axis if required.

In addition to this local co-ordinate system, also a principal (or main) co-ordinate system can be referred to on a 1D member. The principal co-ordinate system of a 1D member is related to the principal co-ordinate system of the cross-section of a 1D member.

Parent ID will ensure that curved edge is imported as straight parts to nonsupporting application, and back to original supporting application as curved geometry. To ensure successful round trip of segmented objects and their related objects, Parent ID needs to be present in both directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Notes

>Complete enumeration of the Formcode, Supported shapes of cross-section and Description ID can be found in chapter Annexes. These properties are set in the object [StructuralCrossSection](structuralcrosssection.md).
>
>Rotation of local co-ordinate system is measured from origin position of local y-axis and the orientation follows positive rotation according to the right-handed rule.

>Reference to Alignment enums - examples of alignments.

>An example of use of System line type Bottom right can be seen in the picture below. If the shape of the cross-section is not rectangular then boundary box of the cross-section is considered for position of the system line. The results take in count eccentricities, in example: ey=150 mm, ez=250 mm.

>Axis reference is only to illustrate this example, your application can have different cross-section LCS than shown in this example. Alignment of system line should be reflected to your relevant eccentricities based on your cross section LCS.
