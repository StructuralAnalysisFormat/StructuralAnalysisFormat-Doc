# StructuralSurfaceAction

**Surface load**

Defines actions on surfaces â€“ plates, walls. The surface load is defined on the whole slab automatically. If only a part of the main slab is supposed to be subject to this load, a subregion ([StructuralSurfaceMemberRegion](../structural-analysis-elements/structuralsurfacememberregion.md)) must be defined inside the main slab.
