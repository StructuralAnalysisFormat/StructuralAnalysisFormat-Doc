# StructuralCurveMemberRib

**2D member rib**

The 2D member rib is a 1D member related to slabs. The part of the slab which cooperates with the rib is called the effective width. Different values of effective widths can be considered for checks and for calculation of the internal forces.

## Notes

>**LCS of the rib** is set due to the following rules: X is set from the start node to the end node, Z is set in parallelly to Z LCS in the slab ([StructuralSurfaceMember](structuralsurfacemember.md)), Y is determined by right hand rule.

>Alignment possitions the cross sections in relation to the slab it is connected to. Alignment affects results in same way as eccentricity does. It applies eccentricity according to the picture below, where examples of alignment with Eccentricity ez = 0 are shown:
