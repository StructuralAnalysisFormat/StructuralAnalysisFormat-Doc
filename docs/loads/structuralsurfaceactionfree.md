# StructuralSurfaceActionFree

**Free surface load**

```{warning} 
object under development
```

The Free surface load is related to slabs. The load is not defined by the entity it acts on, but by a specific load border. Free loads are defined by means of "loading entities" that may overlap or affect one or more slabs.

## Notes

>When is "Distribution" set to "DirectionX" or "DirectionY" the system is the same, but only two C values have to be defined.
>
>When "Distribution" is set to "DirectionXY" is necessary to define 3 "C" vertexes. These Vertexes are defining projection onto slab and Value of the load as well. According to position and load value of "C" vertexes is load plane defined and every other vertex of the surface load is calculated. See example below.

>The LCS of the load is created based on the order of the nodes defining the load. X axis is in the direction from the first point to the second. Z axis is always perpendicular, and the direction is set by the property Local Z direction. Y axis is then set by the right-hand rule.

>Local Z direction = Positive means that local Z direction will be in the direction of positive global Z direction, if it is not possible then in the positive direction of global X axis, if that is also not possible then in the direction of positive global Y axis.

>Above is in the direction of positive local Z axis from XY plane of the load or from defined distance from that plane. Below is in the direction of negative local Z axis. In the example below load will be generated only between 3 and 4 m from the free load.
